Break It (Free version)
----------------------------------------
Internal version: 1.2
Webpage: http://breakit.drywa.me
Platforms: Windows 8 RT ( x86, x64 )
Status: Finished! ( No more Updates or Changes )

Release Notes:
----------------------------------------
This is only the source code with all the assets missing. Also there is no real Project file so to build the project you have to create a new one and import the source files. This Project is build on top of DirectXTK. I stored the header files in there but i left out the Lib/source files. I don't know if this source is working with the new Version of DirectXTK but I don't really care. This code is just here to show how I coded my first commercial game. The code itself is pretty ugly and I still was learning C++ at the time. If you want to know more about the development process just visit my webpage http://www.drywa.me.
